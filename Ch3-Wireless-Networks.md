# Wireless LAN (WLAN) Overview

## What is WLAN?
A **Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)** is a local network that connects devices using **wireless signals (Wi-Fi)** instead of cables.  
It allows laptops, smartphones, and other devices to access the internet or communicate with each other **without physical wiring**.

## What is IEEE 802.11 Standard?
The **IEEE 802.11 standard** is a set of rules created by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) that define **how wireless LANs (Wi-Fi)** work.  
It specifies things like:
- The **frequency bands** (2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz).  
- How devices **connect and communicate** wirelessly.  
- Different versions (a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be) that improve **speed, range, and reliability** over time.  

In short: **802.11 = the technical foundation of Wi-Fi.**

## Types of WLAN

### 1. Based on Infrastructure
- **Infrastructure WLAN**  
  Devices connect through a central **Access Point (AP)** (e.g., Wi-Fi router).  
  Example: Home Wi-Fi network.
  
- **Ad-hoc WLAN**  
  Devices connect **directly to each other** without an AP.  
  Example: Two laptops sharing files via Wi-Fi Direct.

### 2. Based on IEEE 802.11 Versions
- **802.11a** – Early standard, fast but short range.  
- **802.11b** – Slower, longer range.  
- **802.11g** – Faster than b, widely adopted.  
- **802.11n (Wi-Fi 4)** – Uses multiple antennas (MIMO), higher speed.  
- **802.11ac (Wi-Fi 5)** – High speed on 5 GHz band.  
- **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6 / 6E)** – Faster, efficient, supports many devices at once.  
- **802.11be (Wi-Fi 7)** – Next generation, ultra-high speed, extremely low latency.

### 3. Based on Coverage
- **Indoor WLANs** – Homes, offices, cafés.  
- **Outdoor WLANs** – Public Wi-Fi, stadiums, campuses.

## Wi-Fi Frequency Bands: 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 6 GHz

Wi-Fi uses **radio frequency bands** to transmit data. The most common are **2.4 GHz**, **5 GHz**, and the newer **6 GHz** band.

### Comparison Table

| Feature        | 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi                 | 5 GHz Wi-Fi                    | 6 GHz Wi-Fi (Wi-Fi 6E / 7)     |
|----------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Range**      | Longest (good through walls)  | Medium (weaker through walls)  | Shortest (best in same room)   |
| **Speed**      | Slowest                       | Fast                           | Fastest (multi-gigabit)        |
| **Interference** | High (crowded, many devices) | Lower                          | Very low (new, less crowded)   |
| **Best For**   | Browsing, IoT, long distance  | Gaming, video calls, streaming | AR/VR, 8K video, cloud gaming  |

⚡ Example:  
- **2.4 GHz network** → good for devices far from the router.  
- **5 GHz network** → good for high-speed internet nearby.  
- **6 GHz network** → best for ultra-fast, low-latency tasks in the same room.

## Wireless Antennas in WLAN

Antennas are used in Wi-Fi devices (routers, APs, laptops, phones) to **send and receive radio signals**.  
They determine the **range, coverage, and direction** of wireless communication.

### Types of Wireless Antennas

1. **Omnidirectional Antenna**  
   - Radiates signal in **all directions (360°)**.  
   - Common in Wi-Fi routers.  
   - Best for covering a room or home.  

2. **Directional Antenna**  
   - Focuses signal in **one direction**.  
   - Provides longer range and stronger signal in that direction.  
   - Examples: Yagi antenna, panel antenna.  
   - Used in point-to-point Wi-Fi links (e.g., between buildings).  

3. **Sector Antenna**  
   - Radiates signal in a **specific sector (e.g., 60°–120° arc)**.  
   - Used in outdoor Wi-Fi networks and cell towers to cover zones.  

4. **Parabolic/Dish Antenna**  
   - Very **highly directional** with long range.  
   - Used for backhaul connections and satellite internet.

## Important Clarification: Bluetooth vs WLAN
- **Bluetooth is not WLAN.**  
- Bluetooth belongs to **WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network)**, which covers only a few meters.  
- **WLAN (Wi-Fi)** covers larger areas (rooms, offices, campuses) and is meant for **internet/data networking**.  

**Examples:**  
- Use **Bluetooth** → headphones, smartwatch, short file transfer.  
- Use **Wi-Fi (WLAN)** → internet access, streaming, gaming, office networking.

## Summary
- **WLAN = Wireless version of LAN using Wi-Fi.**  
- Based on **IEEE 802.11 standard** (a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be).  
- Works on **2.4 GHz (long range, slower)**, **5 GHz (medium range, faster)**, and **6 GHz (short range, ultra-fast)** bands.  
- Uses **different antennas (omnidirectional, directional, sector, parabolic)** for coverage needs.  
- Main types: **Infrastructure WLAN** and **Ad-hoc WLAN**.  
- **Bluetooth ≠ WLAN** → It is a **short-range WPAN technology**.
