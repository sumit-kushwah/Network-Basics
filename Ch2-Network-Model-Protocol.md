# Open System Interconnection(OSI) Model
1.	The OSI model is a step-by-step guide for how data moves between computers in a network.
2.	Application layer ‚Üí where users interact (e.g., browser sending a request).
3.	Presentation layer ‚Üí translates, encrypts, or compresses the data.
4.	Session layer ‚Üí manages the conversation (start, maintain, end).
5.	Transport layer ‚Üí breaks data into smaller pieces (segments) and ensures they arrive correctly and in order.
6.	Network layer ‚Üí decides the path using IP addresses.
7.	Data Link layer ‚Üí uses MAC addresses to deliver data inside the local network.
8.	Physical layer ‚Üí turns data into signals (electrical pulses, light, or radio waves) that travel through cables or Wi-Fi.
9.	Each layer adds or removes its own ‚Äúenvelope,‚Äù so the message can safely travel from sender to receiver.

### OSI Model PDU
At the Transport layer, data becomes a segment, which the Network layer wraps with an IP header to make a packet, and then the Data Link layer wraps that packet with MAC addresses and error-check info to form a frame; finally, the Physical layer turns the frame into bits for transmission. In theory it‚Äôs a clean 1-to-1 mapping (one segment ‚Üí one packet ‚Üí one frame), but in practice it depends on the protocol ‚Äî e.g., Ethernet usually keeps 1:1, while technologies like ATM or modern Wi-Fi (802.11n/ac/ax) can do segmentation or aggregation, meaning multiple packets may be split across frames or several packets combined into one frame (to improve efficiency).

## TCP/IP Model
‚ö° Difference Between OSI and TCP/IP
1.	Number of Layers:
    - OSI has 7 layers.
    - TCP/IP has 4 layers (some OSI layers are combined).
2.	Nature:
    - OSI is a theoretical reference model (conceptual).
    - TCP/IP is a practical model (used in real-world networking).
3.	Usage:
    - OSI helps us learn and understand networking in detail, layer by layer.
    - TCP/IP is the actual protocol stack used on the internet.

# üåê NAT (Network Address Translation)

## What is NAT?
- NAT is a process that allows **multiple devices to share a single public IP address**.  
- It works by translating **private IPs (used inside home or local networks)** into a **public IP** (used on the internet).  
- From the outside world, all devices appear as if they are coming from **one IP address**.

---

## üîπ Why NAT is Needed
- IPv4 has only **4.3 billion unique addresses**, which are not enough for all devices in the world.  
- NAT solves this problem by allowing many devices to hide behind a single public IP.  
- Example: 10 devices in your home use only **1 public IP** instead of 10.

---

## üîÑ How NAT Works
1. Each device in the LAN (e.g., phone, laptop) gets a **private IP** (like `192.168.x.x`).  
2. The router (or phone hotspot) has **one public IP** from the ISP.  
3. When a device sends data to the internet:
   - NAT **replaces the private IP** with the router‚Äôs public IP.  
   - It also assigns a **unique port number** to keep track of which device made the request.  
4. When the response comes back, NAT checks the port mapping and sends the reply to the correct private IP.  

---

## üè† Example: Home NAT
- Laptop ‚Üí `192.168.1.2`  
- Phone ‚Üí `192.168.1.3`  
- Router ‚Üí `103.25.64.12` (public IP from ISP)  

Both laptop and phone appear as **103.25.64.12** on the internet.  
Router uses **ports** to know which reply belongs to which device.  

---

## üì± Example: Mobile Hotspot
- Laptop connects to your phone‚Äôs hotspot.  
- Laptop gets a **private IP** like `192.168.43.101` from your phone.  
- Phone itself gets an IP from the **mobile carrier**:
  - Sometimes a **public IP**.  
  - Often a **private IP** (like `10.x.x.x`) with **Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)**.  
- Phone performs NAT for your laptop, translating its private IP into the phone‚Äôs carrier IP.  

---

## üîπ Carrier-Grade NAT (CGNAT)
- Used by mobile carriers and ISPs to conserve IPv4.  
- Many customers share **one public IP** at the ISP level.  
- Your phone may see a private IP (`10.x.x.x`), but websites see the ISP‚Äôs public IP.  
- This is why your phone and laptop may appear to have **different external IPs** in some cases.

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of NAT
- Saves IPv4 addresses (many devices use **1 public IP**).  
- Adds a layer of **security** since private IPs are hidden from the internet.  
- Allows local devices to communicate using private IPs.

---

## üö® Limitations of NAT
- Makes **incoming connections difficult** (requires port forwarding).  
- Can cause issues with **gaming, VoIP, or peer-to-peer apps**.  
- NAT complexity increases with **Carrier-Grade NAT**, making some applications harder to use.

---

## üîë Key Takeaways
- **At home:** Router gets 1 public IP ‚Üí all devices share it via NAT.  
- **On mobile:** Phone gets IP from carrier ‚Üí laptop gets private IP from phone ‚Üí phone does NAT.  
- **If carrier runs CGNAT:** Multiple phones/customers share the same public IP at the ISP level.  
- NAT is the reason we are still able to use IPv4 widely despite address scarcity.  


# ‚è∞ NTP (Network Time Protocol)

## What is NTP?
- **NTP** (Network Time Protocol) is used to **synchronize clocks** of computers and devices over a network.  
- Without NTP, device clocks drift apart, causing problems in **logs, security, banking, and communication**.  
- NTP is extremely accurate:  
  - **Milliseconds** over the internet.  
  - **Microseconds** in local networks.

---

## üîÑ How NTP Works
1. Device sends a request to an NTP server.  
2. NTP server replies with the current time.  
3. Device uses **4 timestamps (T1‚ÄìT4)** to calculate:  
   - **Delay** (round-trip network time).  
   - **Offset** (difference between device and server clocks).  
4. Device adjusts its clock gradually to stay in sync.  
5. NTP repeats periodically (every few minutes to hours) to keep time accurate.  

---

## üìö Key Details
- **Port**: 123 (UDP)  
- **OSI Layer**: Application (Layer 7)  
- **Hierarchy**:  
  - Stratum 0 ‚Üí Atomic/GPS clocks (most accurate).  
  - Stratum 1 ‚Üí Servers directly connected to Stratum 0.  
  - Stratum 2+ ‚Üí Devices syncing from higher strata.  

---

## ‚úÖ Benefits of NTP
- Keeps all devices on the same time reference.  
- Essential for **security certificates, Kerberos, logs, banking, and distributed systems**.  
- Corrects for **network delay**, unlike simple time sync methods.

## ‚öñÔ∏è NTP vs HTTP Time Requests

| Feature              | **NTP**                           | **HTTP Time**              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Protocol             | Specialized (UDP/123)             | General HTTP (TCP/80/443)  |
| Accuracy             | Milliseconds (internet), ¬µs (LAN) | Often off by 100‚Äì500 ms+   |
| Delay Correction     | ‚úÖ Yes (uses T1‚ÄìT4 timestamps)     | ‚ùå No (ignores network delay) |
| Frequency            | Periodic sync, adaptive intervals | Only when polled manually  |
| Usage                | OS clock sync (default in OS)     | Simple APIs, IoT hacks     |

---

## üîë In Short
- **NTP = accurate, delay-aware clock sync** (used by all major OSes).  
- **HTTP = simple, but inaccurate** (delay ignored, only for lightweight apps).  
- That‚Äôs why NTP is the **standard protocol for time synchronization** worldwide.
