## Chapters Overview

### 1. [Introduction](Ch1-Introduction.md)
This chapter introduces the basics of networking, including:
- Types of networks (PAN, LAN, WAN, etc.).
- Benefits of networking, such as resource sharing and communication.
- Network addresses:
  - **MAC Address**: Unique physical address of a device.
  - **IPv4/IPv6**: Logical addresses used for communication.
- Key network components:
  - **NIC**: Connects devices to a network.
  - **Switch**: Forwards data based on MAC addresses.
  - **Router**: Routes data between networks using IP addresses.
  - **Wireless Access Point (WAP)**: Bridges wired and wireless networks.
- Overview of cabling (copper and fiber optic).

### 2. [Network Model and Protocols](Ch2-Network-Model-Protocol.md)
This chapter explains the theoretical and practical models of networking:
- **OSI Model**: A 7-layer model that describes how data moves through a network.
- **TCP/IP Model**: A 4-layer practical model used in real-world networking.
- Protocols like:
  - **DHCP**: Automatically assigns IP addresses.
  - **DNS**: Translates domain names to IP addresses.
  - **NAT**: Allows multiple devices to share a single public IP.
  - **NTP**: Synchronizes clocks over a network.

### 3. [Wireless Networks](Ch3-Wireless-Networks.md)
This chapter focuses on wireless networking:
- **WLAN (Wi-Fi)**: Basics of wireless local area networks.
- **IEEE 802.11 Standards**: Evolution of Wi-Fi (a/b/g/n/ac/ax/be).
- Wi-Fi frequency bands:
  - **2.4 GHz**: Long range, slower speed.
  - **5 GHz**: Medium range, faster speed.
  - **6 GHz**: Short range, ultra-fast speed.
- Types of antennas (omnidirectional, directional, etc.).
- Comparison of **Bluetooth** and **Wi-Fi**.

### 4. [Emerging Trends](Ch4-Emerging-Trends.md)
This chapter explores modern advancements in networking:
- **Software Defined Networking (SDN)**:
  - Separates the control plane and data plane for centralized management.
  - Benefits include automation, flexibility, and cost savings.
- **Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)**:
  - Creates secure tunnels for private communication over the internet.
  - Benefits include privacy, security, and bypassing geo-restrictions.
- **Mobile Network Generations (1G to 6G)**:
  - Evolution of mobile networks, from analog voice (1G) to AI-driven IoT (6G).

### 5. [IP Addressing](Ch5-IP-Addressing.md)
This chapter dives into the role of IP addresses in networking:
- **IPv4 and IPv6**:
  - Structure, network/host division, and examples.
- Key concepts:
  - **Subnet Mask**: Defines the network and host portions of an IP.
  - **Default Gateway**: The "exit door" to other networks.
  - **DNS**: Resolves domain names to IP addresses.
- **DHCP**:
  - Automatically assigns IP configurations to devices.
  - Explains the 4-step process (Discover → Offer → Request → Ack).
- **IPv4 Classes**:
  - Overview of Class A, B, C, D, and E.
  - Special ranges like private IPs and loopback addresses.
- **IPv6**:
  - Address format, unicast/multicast/anycast, and comparison with IPv4.
