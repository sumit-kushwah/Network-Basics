# Software Defined Networking (SDN)

## What is SDN?
Software Defined Networking (SDN) is a way to manage networks by separating:
- **Control plane** (the brain: decides where data goes)
- **Data plane** (the hands: forwards the data)

In SDN, a central **controller (software)** makes decisions and tells all devices (like routers and switches) what to do.

---

## Why do we need SDN?
- Traditional networks are hard to manage and slow to change.
- Each device has to be configured separately.
- Big data centers, cloud, and 5G need faster, flexible networks.

---

## Benefits of SDN
- **Centralized control** – one brain for the whole network.
- **Easy management** – configure through software instead of device-by-device.
- **Automation** – less manual work, faster changes.
- **Flexibility** – network can adjust quickly to traffic changes.
- **Cost saving** – uses simple hardware, intelligence in software.

## Real-life Examples
- **Google** – Uses SDN in its private network (B4) to manage traffic between data centers worldwide.  
- **Netflix** – Uses SDN to deliver smooth video streaming by routing traffic efficiently.  
- **Amazon (AWS)** – Uses SDN for cloud networking, letting customers create virtual networks.  
- **Facebook (Meta)** – Uses SDN in data centers to keep apps like Instagram and WhatsApp running.  
- **Telecom Companies (5G)** – Use SDN for network slicing (splitting one network into many virtual ones).  
- **Home Routers** – Normal home routers (like TP-Link, Netgear) **do not use SDN**; they manage traffic themselves. They have both control plane (brain) and data plane (forwarding) inside the same box. You configure them manually using the web page (192.168.x.x). However, ISP-controlled or mesh Wi-Fi systems may use **SDN-like control** in the background for remote management.

# Virtual Private Network (VPN)

## What is a VPN?
A VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a service that creates a secure and private tunnel between your device and the internet.

---

## How does it work?
1. You connect your device to a VPN server.
2. All your internet traffic is encrypted and sent through this secure tunnel.
3. The VPN server then forwards your traffic to the website or service you want.
4. The website only sees the VPN server’s IP address, not your real one.

---

## Why does IP address change with VPN?
- Without VPN: Websites see your ISP-assigned IP address (your online home address).
- With VPN: Your traffic goes through the VPN server, so websites see the VPN server’s IP address.
- This hides your location and identity, and can make it look like you are browsing from another country.

---

## Benefits of VPN
- **Privacy** – hides your real IP address.  
- **Security** – encrypts data so hackers/ISP cannot read it.  
- **Access** – lets you reach content blocked in your country.  

# Mobile Network Generations (1G to 6G)

### Comparison Table

| Generation | Time Period | Speed (Approx) | Benefits | Limitations |
|------------|-------------|----------------|----------|-------------|
| **1G**     | 1980s       | ~2.4 Kbps      | - First mobile phones<br>- Basic voice | - Poor quality<br>- No security<br>- No internet |
| **2G**     | 1990s       | ~100 Kbps      | - Digital voice<br>- SMS/MMS<br>- Secure | - Very slow internet<br>- Limited multimedia |
| **3G**     | 2000s       | ~1–10 Mbps     | - Internet<br>- Video calls<br>- Email | - High battery use<br>- Slower for modern apps |
| **4G**     | 2010s       | ~100 Mbps      | - Fast internet<br>- HD video<br>- Apps & gaming | - Needs strong coverage<br>- Can congest |

### Technology Types Explained
- **1G (Analog voice, FDMA)** – voice as analog waves, poor quality.  
- **2G (Digital GSM/CDMA, TDMA/CDMA)** – digital 0s/1s, more secure, supports SMS.  
- **3G (UMTS, CDMA2000 – mixed switching)** – voice (circuit switching) + data (packet).  
- **4G (LTE – All IP)** – fully packet-switched, internet-first, HD streaming.  
- **5G (New Radio, mmWave, Massive MIMO)** – smart antennas, beamforming, very fast.  
- **6G (Future, AI + THz spectrum)** – still in research, extreme IoT and holograms.

## 4. Key Terms

### Analog
- Continuous radio waves (like FM radio).
- Poor quality, no encryption.  
*(Used in 1G)*

### Digital
- Converts voice/data into **0s and 1s**.  
- Clearer, encrypted, supports SMS.  
*(Used in 2G)*

### Packet Switching
- Breaks data into **packets** (small chunks).  
- Efficient, can share same line.  
*(Used in 3G for data, fully in 4G and beyond)*

### New Radio (NR)
- 5G standard with **mmWave, beamforming, massive MIMO**.  
- Very fast, supports millions of devices.  
*(Used in 5G, base for 6G)*

---

### Circuit Switching vs Packet Switching

### Circuit Switching
- A **dedicated line** is reserved for the call.  
- Example: Old landline phone call.  
- Pros: Constant quality.  
- Cons: Wastes capacity if silent (no data sent).

### Packet Switching
- Data is split into packets, each packet finds best path.  
- Example: WhatsApp call, internet browsing.  
- Pros: Efficient, supports many users.  
- Cons: Packets may arrive late or out of order.

## 6. How Digital Data is Sent in Mobile Networks

1. **Convert to binary** – Voice/video → 0s and 1s.  
2. **Modulation** – 0s and 1s are mapped onto radio waves by changing:  
   - Amplitude (height)  
   - Frequency (speed)  
   - Phase (angle)  
   - Or a mix (QAM).  
3. **Multiple users share** – using TDMA (time slots), CDMA (codes), or OFDMA (channels).  
4. **Send to cell tower** – tower decodes and routes to internet or another user.  
5. **Reassemble** – receiver converts 0s and 1s back to voice, text, or video.

### Simple Analogy
Think of sending **Morse code with a flashlight**:  
- "Light on" = 1, "Light off" = 0.  
- In mobile networks, instead of a flashlight, we change the **shape of radio waves**.
